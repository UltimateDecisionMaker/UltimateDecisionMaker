The Motivition
==============

| How often do you look at a menu and still can’t decide what you will eat?
| Here come’s the solution!
| With this Ultimate Decision Maker, you only need to take a photo of 
| anything you can't decide. The algorithm will automatically detect words,
| objects, and choices, and :strike:`randomly select one` find your destiny for you!!!
| 
| Next time you pondering which direction to go, just let Ultimate Decision Maker
| to help you find your destiny!
|
| Design Flow:
| Take a photo of the menu:
| —> API to recognize items on the menu
| —> steal Shannon’s random pair generator to make decision
| —> return that decision.
| 
| Optional stretch feature:
| before pair generation, allow user to select and de-select items + maybe allow
| relationships (e.g. I want 1 from entree, and 1 from dessert.)
