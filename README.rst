The Motivition
==============

| How often do you look at a menu and still can’t decide what you will eat?
| Here come’s the solution!

Design Flow:
Take a photo of the menu:
—> API to recognize items on the menu
—> steal Shannon’s random pair generator to make decision
—> return that decision.

Optional stretch feature:
before pair generation, allow user to select and de-select items + maybe allow
relationships (e.g. I want 1 from entree, and 1 from dessert.)
